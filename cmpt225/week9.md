# ðŸ“š CMPT 225 â€“ Week 9 Key Definitions

## **Skip List**

* **Skip List** â€“ A probabilistic data structure for ordered elements allowing fast search, insertion, and deletion.
* **Height (h)** â€“ Number of levels in the skip list.
* **Coin Flip Mechanic** â€“ Determines how many levels a new entry occupies.
* **QuadNode Structure** â€“ Each node stores `data`, and pointers to `above`, `below`, `next`, and `prev`.
* **TowerNode Structure** â€“ Each tower represented as a single node with an array of forward pointers.

**Complexity**:

* **Worst-case**: $O(n + h)$ for search, insert, remove.
* **Average**: $O(\log n)$ for search, insert, remove.
* **Space**: Average $O(n)$, worst $O(hn)$.

## **Dictionary ADT**

* **Dictionary** â€“ Searchable collection of keyâ€“element pairs allowing duplicate keys.
* **Operations**:

  * `get(k)` â€“ Return an entry with key $k$.
  * `getAll(k)` â€“ Return all entries with key $k$.
  * `put(k, v)` â€“ Insert new entry.
  * `remove(e)` â€“ Remove a given entry.
  * `entrySet()` â€“ Return all entries.
  * `isEmpty()` â€“ Check if empty.
  * `size()` â€“ Number of entries.
* **Implementations**:

  * Unordered linked list.
  * Hash table with separate chaining.
  * Ordered array (search table).
  * Skip list.

## **AVL Tree**

* **AVL Tree** â€“ Self-balancing binary search tree.
* **Height-Balancing Property** â€“ Heights of children differ by at most 1.
* **Height Bound** â€“ $h < 2 \log_2 n + 2$, $O(\log n)$ complexity.
* **Balance Factor** â€“ $\text{height(right)} - \text{height(left)}$.
* **Rotations**:

  * **Single Rotation** â€“ Left or right.
  * **Double Rotation** â€“ Leftâ€“Right or Rightâ€“Left.
* **Trinode Restructuring** â€“ Rebalancing using three nodes $x, y, z$ ordered as $a, b, c$ in in-order traversal.

**Complexity**:

* Search, Insert, Remove: $O(\log n)$.
* Restructuring: $O(1)$ with linked structure.

## **(2, 4) Tree**

* **Multi-Way Search Tree** â€“ Internal node can have multiple keys and children.
* **d-node** â€“ Node with $d$ children.
* **Properties**:

  1. **Minimum Child Requirement** â€“ Internal node has at least 2 children.
  2. **Keyâ€“Child Correlation** â€“ d-node has $d - 1$ keys in sorted order.
  3. **Interleaved Ordering** â€“ Keys in subtrees follow in-between ordering.
* **(2, 4) Tree** â€“ Special multi-way search tree:

  * Node Size Property â€“ At most 4 children.
  * Depth Property â€“ All external nodes at same depth.
* **Balanced** â€“ No rotations needed.

Do you want me to also add **small visual mnemonics** in the markdown so you can quickly recall the structure of Skip Lists, AVL Trees, and (2,4) Trees during the exam? That could speed up your memorization.
