  <title>WOW Numbers for Canadian Tire’s Gen Z Talent Challenge</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h2>wow number</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>$10,000</strong> – average cost to replace <em>one</em> frontline retail employee, so every Gen Z hire you keep is a five‑figure saving (McKinsey, 2024)</li>
    <li><strong>27 %</strong> – share of the OECD workforce that will be Gen Z by <strong>2025</strong>, turning today’s “next‑gen” into tomorrow’s core staff (World Economic Forum, 2022)</li>
    <li><strong>70 %</strong> of Gen Zers upskill <em>every week</em> (and nearly two‑thirds do it on their own time) – a workforce hungry for growth (Deloitte, 2025)</li>
    <li><strong>52 %</strong> of Gen Z live paycheque‑to‑paycheque, yet <strong>89 %</strong> say a sense of <em>purpose</em> is essential to job satisfaction – meaning you must offer both security <strong>and</strong> meaning to win their loyalty (Deloitte, 2025)</li>
    <li><strong>31 %</strong> of Gen Z workers say they’ll switch employers within the next <strong>two years</strong> —an attrition clock already ticking (Deloitte, 2025)</li>
    <li><strong>72 %</strong> of Gen Z employees have thought about quitting jobs that lack <strong>flexible‑work options</strong> —rigid schedules are a deal‑breaker (LinkedIn, 2025)</li>
